  <p><em>Web Developer in the Making</em></p>
  <br>
  <p>Hi there, I'm aspiring to become a web developer and have been learning for a few months now. I have HTML and CSS pretty much down pact and am now learning JavaScript so I can finally make not only beautiful sites, but very functional and
    interactive ones too!</p>
